# Automatic Eye Disease Prediction

[Project Logo/Icon]

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model developed in Python for the automatic prediction of eye diseases using medical images. The model is trained on a diverse dataset and utilizes deep learning techniques for accurate and efficient disease classification.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The model classifies eye images into various disease categories, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

- **Deep Learning**: Built on a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract complex features from input images, enabling accurate predictions.

- **Open Source**: The project is open source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srilekha_netha/eye-disease-prediction.git
##Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
python DiseaseDetection.py

Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 and upload your eye images for predictions.
